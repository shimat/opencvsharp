    /// GOTURN (@cite GOTURN) is kind of trackers based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// * While taking all advantages of CNN trackers, GOTURN is much faster due to offline training without online fine-tuning nature.
    /// * GOTURN tracker addresses the problem of single target tracking: given a bounding box label of an object in the first frame of the video,
    /// 
    /// * we track that object through the rest of the video.NOTE: Current method of GOTURN does not handle occlusions; however, it is fairly
    /// * robust to viewpoint changes, lighting changes, and deformations.
    /// 
    /// * Inputs of GOTURN are two RGB patches representing Target and Search patches resized to 227x227.
    /// * Outputs of GOTURN are predicted bounding box coordinates, relative to Search patch coordinate system, in format X1, Y1, X2, Y2.
    /// * Original paper is here: [http://davheld.github.io/GOTURN/GOTURN.pdf]
    /// * As long as original authors implementation: [https://github.com/davheld/GOTURN#train-the-tracker]
    /// * Implementation of training algorithm is placed in separately here due to 3d-party dependencies:
    /// *  [https://github.com/Auron-X/GOTURN_Training_Toolkit]
    /// * GOTURN architecture goturn.prototxt and trained model goturn.caffemodel are accessible on opencv_extra GitHub repository.
